My C# Course Portfolio



About Me
I am a passionate learner who recently delved into the world of programming with a focus on C#. Through this course, I aimed to grasp the fundamentals of coding and build a foundation for my journey into software development.

Projects
1. Inventory Management System
I created a basic console application to manage inventory, track products, and generate reports. This project helped me apply C# concepts in a practical scenario.

2. Student Registration Portal
In this project, I built an ASP.NET MVC application that allows students to register for courses and view their schedules. It was my first foray into web development with C#.

3. Weather App
I developed a WPF application that fetches and displays weather information based on user input. It enhanced my understanding of user interface development using C#.

Skills Gained

Frameworks: Explored .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, and WPF, broadening my toolkit for different types of projects.

Database: Learned the basics of database interaction with Entity Framework.

User Interface: Gained insights into creating interfaces using XAML for WPF applications.
